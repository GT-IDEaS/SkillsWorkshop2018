Week 01: Introduction to Python
===============================

This week, our focus is to introduce the Python programming language and a few
tools that we'll be using throughout this course.  Our first project will be to
write Python scripts to solve each of the first five problems from [Project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), in order to:

* acquaint students with solving problems using Python, and
* learn & practice social coding principles with GitHub.

To get started, simply [sign up for an
account](https://projecteuler.net/register) with Project Euler and start trying
to solve the problems! Make sure that you're coding using Python 3.6, available
through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

### Assignment Submission

For each Project Euler problem, please create a Python script implementing your
solution with filename `firstinitiallastname_0x.py` (e.g., `jdoe_01.py` for
John Doe's solution to Problem 01), and placed inside each of the `Problem0x`
subdirectories for this week's assignment. Also, don't forget to include your
journal entry in the pull request description!
