Problem 01: Multiples of 3 and 5
================================

Please write a short Python program to solve Problem 01: Multiples of 3 and 5.
Remember, your script should be named `firstinitiallastname_01.py` (e.g.,
`jdoe_01.py`), to reduce possible conflicts between everyone's solutions.  Once
you have confirmed your solution [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1),
please commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork to
[upstream](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2018), just like in our
hands-on exercise with the [planets](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/planets)
repository.
