Problem 03: Largest Prime Factor
================================

Please write a short Python program to solve Problem 03: Largest Prime Factor.
Your script should be named `firstinitiallastname_03.py` (e.g., `jdoe_03.py`),
to reduce possible conflicts between everyone's solutions.  Once you have
confirmed your solution [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3), please
commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork to
[upstream](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2018), just like in our
hands-on exercise with the [planets](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/planets)
repository.
