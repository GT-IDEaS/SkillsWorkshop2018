Problem 03: Largest Prime Factor
================================
a = []  

f=2
while n % f == 0: #divide out all the even factors
    a.append(f)
    n/=f

f+=1 # onto next factor which must be odd (incrament f by 2 after this point
while f * f <= n: # largest factor f cannot be greater than sqrt(n)
    if (n % f == 0):
        a.append(f)
        n /= f
    else:
        f += 2   
if n!=1: # account for the edge case/last remaining prime after all division 
    a.append(n) 

#we know the value in a increases because we continually incrament f.  The only thing we don't know is if the last value(when we append n in the above edge case) is greater than or less than the last f value appended
if a[-1]<a[-2]:
    print(a[-2])
else:
    print(a[-1])

# also please note I need a little more time to work through number four - I don't want to resort to brute force/I want to be more efficient.  Will put in a solution soon!
