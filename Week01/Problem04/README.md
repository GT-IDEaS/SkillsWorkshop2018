Problem 04: Largest Palindrome Product
======================================

Please write a short Python program to solve Problem 04: Largest Palindrome
Product.  Your script should be named `firstinitiallastname_04.py` (e.g.,
`jdoe_04.py`), to reduce possible conflicts between everyone's solutions.  Once
you have confirmed your solution [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4),
please commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork to
[upstream](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2018), just like in our
