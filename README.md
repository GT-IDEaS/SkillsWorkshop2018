IDEaS Summer Skills Workshop 2017
=================================

Welcome to the Insitute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) Summer Skills
Workshop 2018!

This workshop will attempt to engage graduate students and postdocs in the
comptational sciences, natural sciences, and engineering disciplines to provide
an introduction to scientific computing and programming with emphasis on the
following topics:

* Programming in Python
* Numerical Linear Algebra
* Databases
* Machine Learning

This workshop will consist of a one-hour lecture each week by a faculty member
covering one of the above topics (two lectures for Python, one lecture for each
remaining topic), where a weekly project meant to acquaint participants with
the topic will be assigned.  This lecture will then be followed by a hands-on
session in which the project and any necessary skills will be discussed, and
any questions addressed.  This repository is meant to accompany these hands-on
sessions and projects, as well as introducing workshop participants with the
principles of and best practices for social coding.
