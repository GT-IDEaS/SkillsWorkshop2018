Week 03: Databases & Data Management
====================================

This week, we learned about the field of data management from Prof. Xu Chu, an
Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science.  His lecture slides are
available within this directory as `lecture.pdf`; the video recording of his
lecture will also be made available in the playlist
[here](https://b.gatech.edu/2LtIzHR).  

In our hands-on session this week, we will explore data management in Python
using the Pandas library.  We will use Pandas to process ecological data
according to the [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org) lesson,
["Python for Ecologists"](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/).
During our interactive session this week, we will be utilizing the Pandas
library within a Jupyter notebook.  This lesson has six relevant sections,
listed below; we will attempt to work together through the first three of these
sections during our hands-on session this week. 

**Note:** If you installed Python through a download of the full Anaconda
suite, you should already have Pandas installed.  Otherwise, it can be
installed several ways detailed
[here](http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html).
