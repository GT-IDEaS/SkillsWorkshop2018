Week 03 Assignment
==================

Your assignment for this week is to complete **one** challenge problem of your
choice within each section of the "Python for Ecologists" Data Carpentry lesson
listed below (three challenge problems total).  Your solutions to these
challenge problems should be clearly documented and contained within a single
script or Jupyter notebook, named according to our standard convention as
`jdoe.py` or `jdoe.ipynb`.  

Sections from which to choose challenge problems (one each!): 

1. [Combining DataFrames with
Pandas](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/04-merging-data/)

2.  [Data Workflows and
Automation](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/05-loops-and-functions/)

3. [Data Ingest & Visualization - Matplotlib &
Pandas](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/07-putting-it-all-together/)
