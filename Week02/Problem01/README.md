Problem 01: Fitting and Plotting
================================

Write a python program that uses the x,y data below to complete the tasks in parts a-f below. Turn in your code and figure using the same naming convention as last week: `firstinitiallastname_01.py` and `firstinitiallastname_01.png`.
a) fit a linear curve to the data
b) fit a cubic curve using the scipy
c) find the area underneath the cubic curve over the domain of the data using the tools in scipy
d) plot the data, the linear fit, and the cubic fit in matplotlib. Make sure to give the plot a title and an x and y label. save this figure and turn it in.
e) put the area of the curve on the plot somewhere as text using matplotlib
f) Use the bayesian information criterion to justify which is model is preferable

x = [ 1.,   1.5,  2.,   2.5,  3.,   3.5,  4.,   4.5,  5.,   5.5,  6.,   6.5,  7.,   7.5, 8.,   8.5,  9.,   9.5, 10. ]
y = [3.43, 4.94, 6.45, 9.22, 6.32, 6.11, 4.63, 8.95, 7.8, 8.35, 11.45, 14.71, 11.97, 12.46, 17.42, 17.0, 15.45, 19.15, 20.86]
