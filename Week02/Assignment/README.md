Week 02 Assignment: Fitting and Plotting
========================================

Write a python program that uses the `x, y` data below to complete the tasks in
parts 1-6 below. Once you have completed these parts, submit a pull request
with your script and figure using the same naming convention as last week:
`firstinitiallastname_01.py` (or `.ipynb` if you're using a Jupyter notebook)
and `firstinitiallastname_01.png`.  

Data:
```
x = [ 1.,   1.5,  2.,   2.5,  3.,   3.5,  4.,   4.5,  5.,   5.5,  6.,   6.5,  7.,   7.5, 8.,   8.5,  9.,   9.5, 10. ]
y = [3.43, 4.94, 6.45, 9.22, 6.32, 6.11, 4.63, 8.95, 7.8, 8.35, 11.45, 14.71, 11.97, 12.46, 17.42, 17.0, 15.45, 19.15, 20.86]
```

Parts:
1. Fit a linear curve to the data
2. Fit a cubic curve using the SciPy library  
3. Find the area underneath the cubic curve over the domain of the data using the tools in SciPy
4. Plot the data, the linear fit, and the cubic fit in Matplotlib.  Make sure
to give the plot a title and an x and y label. Save this figure and include it
in your pull request!
5. Put the area of the curve on the plot somewhere as text using Matplotlib
6. Use the Bayesian information criterion to justify which model (linear or cubic)
is preferable.  Include this justification in your journal entry for the week.
