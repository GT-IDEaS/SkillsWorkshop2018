Week 02: Scope, Namespaces, Advanced Python Libraries, & Scientific Computing
=============================================================================

This week, we will be discussing the topics of scope and namespaces, in
addition to utilizing some advanced Python libraries to solve problems in
Scientific Computing.  The slides from the lecture are contained here in
`lecture.pdf`, and the Jupyter Notebook used in the live demo is provided
as `case-study.ipynb`.  

In order to provide an extra level of usability, I've also created a cloud
server which will run any Jupyter notebooks in this repository directly online
without download.  This server can be launched by clicking the "launch binder"
button in the repository-level
[README](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2018/blob/master/README.md)
or by clicking
[here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2018/master). Feel
free to mess around with the code fitting the polynomial, as well as trying out
different plot options, to see what everything does.
