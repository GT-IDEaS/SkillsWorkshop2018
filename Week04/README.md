Week04: Numerical Methods and Numerical Linear Algebra
======================================================

This week, Prof. C. David Sherrill (our workshop organizer!) discussed specific
challenges and details to keep in mind when designing, implementing, and
utilizing numerical approaches to solving problems (numerical methods), as well
as introducing several practical concerns when performing linear algebra
routines on a computer (numerical linear algebra, NLA).  Slides from Prof.
Sherrill's lecture are available within this directory as `lecture.pdf`, and
the recorded lecture will be posted [here](https://b.gatech.edu/2LtIzHR) as
soon as possible.

In our recitation session this week, we will expand on our discussion of NLA
and apply a few new techniques to reduce data dimensionality by selecting the
"important" dimensions using a method called Principal Component Analysis
(PCA).
